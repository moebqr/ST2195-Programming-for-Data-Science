# Block 4: Programming Concepts

### What is Computer Programming?
Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can follow to perform particular tasks.

### Steps for Writing a Program
1. Requirements Collection
2. Plan the steps that the program should take to fulfill its purpose with an algorithm (Solution Design).
AND THEN?

### Algorithms
An algorithm is a sequence of steps that will return a result and terminate after a finite number of steps.
- Typically, the aim is to produce algorithms that are fast and reliable, and require predictable time and resources to run.


## Good Practice in Programming
1. Avoid Spaghetti Code.
    - Poorly planned and not well structured programs.
    - Best Practice: Plan the code with pseudocode before writing the actual code.
2. Structured Programming (Modular Programming)
    - Breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
    - Each part having a single, well-defined task.
    - Easier to understand, test, and maintain.
3. Document Programs Using Comments
    - Comments explain what the code does and why
    - Should be clear and concise
    - Helps other programmers (and yourself) understand the code
    - Write self-explanatory code and don't write verbose comments.
